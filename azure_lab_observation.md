# Azure Networking & Traffic Observation Lab

In this lab, I set up virtual machines in Microsoft Azure, observed different types of network traffic using Wireshark, and experimented with firewall rules. Below is my personal walkthrough and reflections.   

---

## Part 1: Creating Virtual Machines

🔗 [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)

- Created a **Resource Group** to organize my lab environment.
- Created a **Windows 10 Virtual Machine (VM)** and allowed it to create a **new Virtual Network (VNet)** and **Subnet**.
- Created a **Linux (Ubuntu) VM** in the **same VNet and Subnet** as the Windows VM.
- Used **username/password authentication**.
- Confirmed that both VMs were in the same network so they could communicate.

### What I Learned
- How **Resource Groups** act like containers for resources in Azure.
- Why keeping both VMs in the same **VNet/Subnet** is important for internal communication.
- The difference between **Windows VM (for management/observation)** and **Linux VM (for testing traffic)**.

---

## Part 2: Observing ICMP Traffic

- Used **Microsoft Remote Desktop** to connect to my Windows VM.
- Installed **Wireshark** on the Windows VM.
- Started a packet capture and applied a filter for **ICMP traffic**.
- Retrieved the **private IP address** of my Ubuntu VM and pinged it from the Windows VM.
- Observed ICMP **requests and replies** in Wireshark.

### What I Learned
- ICMP packets are how devices communicate using **ping**.
- How to filter for ICMP traffic on Wireshark.
- Some parts of the ICMP packet

---

## Part 3: Network Security Group (Firewall) & Traffic Types

### 🔒 Blocking ICMP Traffic
- Started a **continuous ping** from Windows → Ubuntu VM.
- Disabled **inbound ICMP traffic** in the Ubuntu VM’s **Network Security Group (NSG)**.
- Observed in Wireshark that ICMP stopped responding.
- Re-enabled ICMP, and pings started working again.

#### What I Learned
- How **firewall rules** directly affect traffic.
- ICMP is very useful for testing connectivity, but it can also be controlled for security.

---

### 🔑 Observing SSH Traffic
- In Wireshark, applied a filter for **SSH traffic**.
- From Windows, ran:
  ```powershell
  ssh labuser@<Ubuntu Private IP>
  ```
- Logged into Ubuntu and ran basic commands.
- Observed **encrypted SSH packets** in Wireshark.
<img width="1840" height="598" alt="filter for ssh" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af7b3fd7-3c5c-49e2-86f8-5dd0b885a47c" />

#### What I Learned
- SSH encrypts communication (you can’t read commands in Wireshark, just see encrypted packets).
- Why SSH is much more secure than plain text protocols.

---

### 🟢 Observing DHCP Traffic
- In Wireshark, filtered for **DHCP**.
- On Windows VM, renewed IP with:
  ```powershell
  ipconfig /renew
  ```
- Observed DHCP negotiation process.

<img width="1615" height="995" alt="script dhcp1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15300c1a-8085-4df5-9bdc-b280533e7c73" />

#### What I Learned
- DHCP assigns IPs dynamically.
- You can watch the whole **DISCOVER → OFFER → REQUEST → ACK** handshake in real-time.

---

### 🌐 Observing DNS Traffic
- In Wireshark, filtered for **DNS**.
- Ran:
  ```powershell
  nslookup disney.com
  nslookup pixar.com
  ```
- Observed DNS queries and responses.
<img width="1911" height="1031" alt="results dns" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/513ac325-62b7-4a66-91c2-64f8956fbd0c" />
<img width="1874" height="1012" alt="dns results" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/328dc46d-5b21-4496-8d20-cf4d84982424" />




#### What I Learned
- DNS resolves domain names into IPs.
- Each lookup creates visible DNS query/response traffic.

---

### 🖥️ Observing RDP Traffic
- In Wireshark, filtered for:
  ```
  tcp.port == 3389
  ```
- Saw **constant RDP traffic spam** while connected via Remote Desktop.
<img width="1918" height="1009" alt="rdp traffic" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2af06693-eb1a-44ca-8ad5-e62ae5c18b5a" />


#### What I Learned
- RDP constantly streams desktop updates, so it generates **non-stop traffic**.
- It’s not just when you type or click everything is live-streamed.

---

## 🔥 Lab Cleanup
- Closed Remote Desktop connection.
- Deleted the **Resource Group** in Azure.
- Verified all resources were deleted.

### Final Reflection
This lab helped me:
- Understand how **network protocols** (ICMP, SSH, DHCP, DNS, RDP) behave.
- Use **Wireshark filters** to capture and study different traffic types.
- See how **Azure NSGs (firewalls)** can block or allow traffic in real time.
- Strengthen my knowledge of how cloud networking works under the hood.
